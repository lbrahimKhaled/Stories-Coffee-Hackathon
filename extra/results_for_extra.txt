From the NMF unsupervised analysis on the branch revenue-share data,
 we extracted a small number of latent consumption archetypes and measured how strongly 
 each branch aligns with them. The results show that most branches share a very similar
revenue structure dominated by mixed cold beverages, mixed hot beverages, blended drinks,
and frozen yogurt, meaning the network is largely homogeneous in product mix. 
The dominant-pattern distribution is highly imbalanced (most branches fall into one main pattern),
However, a few branches—most notably Event Starco and the Airport—stand out as structurally different,
with stronger pattern dominance and lower entropy, making them true behavioral outliers.
In summary we can say tyat the data  consumption patterns across locations are broadly consistent,
 with only a small number of distinct branch types emerging from the unsupervised segmentation.
